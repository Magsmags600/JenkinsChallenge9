# Weather Tracker Application

## Project Overview

The **Weather Tracker** is a server-side application built in TypeScript that interacts with the OpenWeather API to retrieve 5-day weather forecasts. Users can search for weather data by city, and their search history is stored in a JSON file. The client-side code is pre-built and cannot be modified, so the focus is on developing the server-side functionalities.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieves 5-day weather forecasts for any city using the OpenWeather API.
- **Search History**: Stores a history of user searches, which can be retrieved or deleted.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes routes for managing weather data and search history.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `.env` to securely manage the OpenWeather API key.
